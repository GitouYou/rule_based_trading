# Rule-based Trading Strategy

## Introduction

Develop a trading strategy using my intuition and Technical Analysis, and test it against a stock using a market simulator. For a Machine Learning-based approach, see [Q-learning trading](https://github.com/ntrang086/q_learning_trading).

**Data Details, Dates and Rules**

* Use the symbol JPM (see the **Data** section below for download link)
* The in sample/development period is January 1, 2008 to December 31 2009.
* The out of sample/testing period is January 1, 2010 to December 31 2011.
* Starting cash is $100,000.
* Allowable positions are: 1000 shares long, 1000 shares short, 0 shares.
* Benchmark: The performance of a portfolio starting with $100,000 cash, investing in 1000 shares of JPM and holding that position.
* There is no limit on leverage.
* Transaction costs for RuleBasedStrategy: Commission: $9.95, Impact: 0.005.
* Transaction costs for BestPossibleStrategy: Commission: $0.00, Impact: 0.00.

## Code

* `indicators.py` - Implements indicators as functions that operate on Pandas series. The "main" code generates the charts that illustrate the indicators in the notebook `rule_based_test.ipynb`.

* `marketsim.py` - Accepts dataframes of trades and retrieve statistics showing performances of the portfolio vs. benchmark.

* `BestPossibleStrategy.py` - This strategy assumes that we can see the future. It creates a set of trades that represents the best a strategy could possibly do during a period. This is to give an idea of an upper bound on performance. It implements `testPolicy()` which returns a trades dataframe. The main part of this code calls marketsim.py as necessary to generate stats and plots.

* `RuleBasedStrategy.py`: It incorporates technical indicators from indicators.py into `trading_strategy()` to create order signals. It implements `testPolicy()` which reads the order signals and returns a trades dataframe. The main part of this code calls marketsim.py as necessary to generate stats and plots.

* `rule_based_test.ipynb`: This is an analysis that calls `testPolicy()` from RuleBasedStrategy.py and relevant functions from `marketsim.py` to plot and compare in-sample and out-of-sample performances of the portfolio vs. benchmark.

## Setup

You need Python 2.7.x or 3.x, and the following packages: pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Data

Data files can be downloaded from [this link](http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/images/a/af/ML4T_2017Fall.zip) or from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

Place the data into a directory named 'data' and it should be one level above this repository.

## Run

To run any script file, use:

```bash
python <script.py>
```

To run any IPython Notebook, use:

```bash
jupyter notebook <notebook_name.ipynb>
```
